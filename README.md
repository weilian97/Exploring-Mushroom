# Exploring Mushroom
 
Mushrooms exist in a variety of different colors, shapes, sizes, textures, etc. In this project, I will analyze an extensive mushroom dataset from UCI using bar charts and acquaint yourself with the diverse array of mushrooms that exist worldwide.
Read through this table to get a sense of the type(s) of variables in the data and the structure of the table. It may also be helpful to read through the information on Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification).
